---

If you've been researching luxury bag rental, you've almost certainly come across Vivrelle. They're the biggest name in the space, with press coverage from major outlets, a deep catalog of designer bags and jewelry, and years of brand recognition. For a long time, they were effectively the only serious option.

That's changed. The Handoffs launched with a model that directly addresses a gap Vivrelle hasn't filled: the ability for bag owners to earn from their own collections. But beyond that headline difference, the two services diverge in pricing structure, membership philosophy, and who they're best suited for.

This isn't a hit piece. Vivrelle is a good service. But the two platforms are built differently, and depending on what you want from a bag rental membership, one may be a significantly better fit than the other. Here's an honest breakdown.

## The Core Difference: Who Supplies the Bags

This is the single most important distinction between the two services, and it shapes everything else.

**Vivrelle** owns all of its inventory. They purchase bags, authenticate them in-house, and make them available to members. This is a traditional one-sided model: the company owns the supply, and customers rent from the company.

**The Handoffs** operates a two-sided model. Some bags are owned by the platform, but members can also [contribute their own luxury bags to the rental pool](/for-bag-owners) and earn credits for every 30-day cycle the bag is available. This means the inventory grows through its membership, and bag owners have a financial incentive to participate.

Why does this matter?

For renters: a two-sided model means a more diverse and growing inventory over time. As more members contribute, the catalog expands organically — including rare pieces and styles that a single company might not invest in purchasing.

For bag owners: The Handoffs offers something Vivrelle simply doesn't — a way to monetize bags you already own. If you have luxury bags sitting unused, Vivrelle has nothing for you. The Handoffs lets you [earn up to $60 per 30-day cycle](/for-bag-owners) for each contributed bag, with credits that offset your membership cost.

## Pricing Comparison

Both services use monthly memberships, but the structures differ.

### Vivrelle's Tiers

Vivrelle offers four membership levels. The entry-level tier starts around $49/month but limits you to a selection of "everyday" bags — think Coach, Tory Burch, and lower-priced designer options. To access iconic luxury bags from Chanel, Hermès, or Dior, you need to be on a higher tier, which runs $199–$249/month.

This tiered approach means the advertised starting price doesn't tell the full story. If you're joining a luxury bag rental service because you want to carry a [Chanel Classic Flap](/collection/chanel) or an [Hermès Lindy](/collection/hermes), you're looking at the upper tiers.

### The Handoffs' Plans

The Handoffs offers two tiers:

- **Standard: $149/month** — one bag at a time, full catalog access, unlimited swaps
- **Premium: $229/month** — two bags at a time, full catalog access, unlimited swaps

The key distinction: both tiers give you access to the entire catalog from day one. There's no restricted selection at the lower tier. A Standard member can request a [Chanel](/collection/chanel), [Hermès](/collection/hermes), [Louis Vuitton](/collection/louis-vuitton), or any other brand just as easily as a Premium member. The only difference is how many bags you can have out at once.

### The Earning Offset

This is where The Handoffs' pricing becomes more interesting than it looks on paper. If you contribute bags, your credits reduce your effective membership cost.

Contributing one bag: $60/month in credits → your effective Standard membership is $89/month.
Contributing two bags: $120/month → your effective Standard membership is $29/month.
Contributing three bags: $180/month → your membership is free, and you're banking $31/month in excess credits.

Vivrelle has no equivalent mechanism. Your membership cost is your membership cost.

## Bag Selection

### Vivrelle

Vivrelle's catalog is large and well-curated. They carry bags from most major luxury houses — Chanel, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, and others. They've also expanded into jewelry, which is a genuine differentiator for members who want both accessories and bags under one membership.

The depth within brands tends to be strong on popular styles. You'll find multiple colorways of bestselling models and seasonal pieces. Where Vivrelle is weaker is on rare or unusual pieces — because they own all inventory, they tend to buy what they know will be in high demand.

### The Handoffs

The Handoffs carries bags from [22 luxury houses](/collection), including all the major names: Chanel, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Valentino, Loewe, Celine, Givenchy, Goyard, and others.

Because inventory includes member-contributed bags, the catalog can include pieces that a company might not purchase on its own — vintage styles, limited editions, and less mainstream brands that individual collectors happen to own. This creates a more eclectic and personal catalog that evolves with its membership.

The Handoffs does not currently offer jewelry.

## Authentication and Insurance

Both platforms authenticate every bag in their catalog in-house, using teams trained to verify authenticity by examining serial numbers, materials, hardware, and construction. Neither service relies solely on certificates of authenticity from sellers.

Both services fully insure bags during the rental period. If a bag is damaged while in a renter's possession, the platform handles it. Renters aren't charged for normal wear, and bag owners (at The Handoffs) are never asked to cover damage caused by renters.

On this front, the two services are essentially equal.

## The Experience

### Vivrelle

Vivrelle has invested heavily in its brand experience. The unboxing is polished — bags arrive in premium packaging. The app and website are clean and well-designed. Blog content covers fashion trends and styling tips. The overall feel is luxury-forward and editorial.

For members who value the full brand experience — the feeling that they're part of something upscale — Vivrelle delivers.

### The Handoffs

The Handoffs takes a more community-oriented approach. The membership model is designed to feel like a club rather than a service: members rent from each other's collections, contribute to the pool, and participate in a circular system. The experience emphasizes the relationship between renting and earning rather than one-directional consumption.

The site is clean and modern, though as a newer service it hasn't yet built the editorial depth that Vivrelle has accumulated over years.

## Who Should Choose Vivrelle

Vivrelle is the right choice if:

- **You want the most established brand.** Vivrelle has been around longer, has more press coverage, and has the largest existing membership base. If brand recognition and track record matter to you, they're the known quantity.
- **You want jewelry too.** Vivrelle's jewelry selection is a genuine differentiator. If you want to rent statement necklaces and earrings alongside bags, they're the only major option.
- **You don't own luxury bags.** If you're purely a renter with no interest in the earning side, Vivrelle's model serves you well (though you'll want to compare pricing tier for tier to make sure you're getting equivalent catalog access).

## Who Should Choose The Handoffs

The Handoffs is the right choice if:

- **You own luxury bags and want to earn from them.** This is the clearest differentiator. If you have bags sitting unused, The Handoffs is the only major platform that turns them into an income stream. [Learn how contributing works →](/for-bag-owners)
- **You want full catalog access at a lower price.** The Handoffs' Standard plan at $149/month gives you access to every brand in the catalog — including Chanel and Hermès. To get equivalent access at Vivrelle, you'd need their $199–$249 tier.
- **You care about circular fashion.** The two-sided model — where existing bags stay in circulation rather than new inventory being purchased — aligns with the growing movement toward sustainable luxury. [Read more about our approach →](/how-it-works)
- **You want a simpler pricing model.** Two tiers, full access on both, no restricted catalogs. What you see is what you get.
- **You want your membership to pay for itself.** With the earning model, active contributors can reduce or eliminate their net membership cost — something that's structurally impossible with Vivrelle.

## The Bottom Line

Vivrelle is a strong, established service with a polished experience and the deepest catalog in the market. For pure renters who want the biggest brand name and don't have bags to contribute, it's a solid choice — particularly at the upper tiers where catalog access opens up.

The Handoffs is built for a different kind of member: someone who wants to participate in both sides of the luxury bag economy. If you own bags and rent bags — or if you're drawn to the idea of a community-powered catalog where your closet contributes to the pool — the two-sided model offers something no one-directional rental service can match.

Both services authenticate thoroughly, insure fully, and deliver a premium experience. The question isn't which is better — it's which fits the way you think about luxury bags.
