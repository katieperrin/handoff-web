Carrying a Chanel Classic Flap or a Louis Vuitton Neverfull used to mean one thing: spending thousands of dollars. But luxury bag rental services have fundamentally changed the equation. For a monthly fee — often less than a single restaurant dinner for two — you can rotate through designer handbags the way you rotate through outfits.

The catch? Not all rental services are built the same. Some own all their inventory. Some let you rent peer-to-peer. Some charge per bag, others charge a flat monthly rate. And the differences between them can mean hundreds of dollars a year and a completely different experience.

We compared the biggest names in luxury bag rental to help you figure out which one actually fits the way you live.

## What We Looked At

We evaluated each service on six factors that matter most to real renters: monthly cost, bag selection, authentication process, flexibility (how long you keep bags, how quickly you swap), insurance coverage, and whether the service lets bag owners earn from their own collections. That last one might sound niche, but it's becoming a deciding factor for a growing number of women who want to participate on both sides of the rental economy.

## The Services

### The Handoffs

The Handoffs is a members-only rental club built on a model that none of the bigger players have replicated: it's two-sided. Members pay a flat monthly fee ($149 for Standard, $229 for Premium) to borrow from the full catalog of authenticated bags — [Chanel](/collection/chanel), [Hermès](/collection/hermes), [Louis Vuitton](/collection/louis-vuitton), Dior, Prada, and about twenty other houses. But here's what makes it different: if you already own luxury bags, you can contribute them to the rental pool and [earn up to $60 in credits per 30-day cycle](/for-bag-owners).

That "contribute and earn" side is genuinely unique. It means the inventory grows organically from members themselves, and bag owners finally have a low-effort way to monetize pieces sitting unused in their closets. Authentication is handled in-house, shipping is covered both ways, and bags are fully insured during the rental period.

Standard members get one bag at a time with no time limits on how long they keep it. Premium members get two bags at a time. There are no per-rental fees beyond the monthly membership.

**Best for:** Women who want a clean, flat-rate membership with the option to earn from bags they already own. If you have a bag collection gathering dust, this is the only service that turns that into a financial asset.

**Starting at:** $149/month | [View membership options](/membership)

### Vivrelle

Vivrelle is the most established name in luxury bag rental and the current market leader. They own all their inventory, which they claim allows tighter quality control. Plans range from $49 to $249 per month across four tiers, with the lower tiers restricting you to "everyday" bags and higher tiers unlocking access to premier and limited-edition pieces.

The brand selection is strong — Vivrelle carries Chanel, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Dior, and most other major houses, plus they've expanded into jewelry. Their site is polished, they've earned major press coverage (CNN, Vogue, Forbes), and the overall experience is professional.

The limitation is the tiered access model. At the $49 tier, you're limited to a smaller selection. To access iconic pieces — a Birkin, a Boy bag, a Saddle — you need the $199 or $249 plan. And Vivrelle doesn't offer any way for bag owners to participate. If you own luxury bags, they're of no use to you here.

**Best for:** Renters who want the most established brand with the deepest catalog and don't mind paying more for top-tier access.

**Starting at:** $49/month (limited selection) to $249/month (full access)

### Rent the Runway

Rent the Runway is a household name, but it's important to understand that bags are not their focus. RTR is primarily a clothing rental platform that happens to include handbags and jewelry. Their subscription plans range from $98 to $235 per month, and the number of "spots" you get (items you can have at one time) varies by tier.

The bag selection exists, but it's smaller and skews toward contemporary brands rather than ultra-luxury. You'll find Coach, Kate Spade, and some designer options, but the Hermès and Chanel inventory is limited compared to bag-focused services. RTR's strength is if you also want to rent clothing — bundling bags with dresses, blazers, and accessories can make the higher price tiers worthwhile.

**Best for:** Women who want a one-stop rental for their entire wardrobe, not just bags. Not ideal if luxury handbags are your primary interest.

**Starting at:** $98/month

### Switch

Switch offers a straightforward bag rental subscription. Plans start at $59 per month and go up to $164 for their premium tier. Like Vivrelle, Switch owns its inventory and offers tiered access — lower plans get more basic bags, higher plans unlock premier options.

The selection is decent but more limited than Vivrelle or The Handoffs, and the platform has less editorial content and community features. Switch's appeal is simplicity and a slightly lower entry price point. If you want a no-frills bag rental without a lot of bells and whistles, it works.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious renters who want a simple, lower-cost way to try designer bags.

**Starting at:** $59/month

### Bag Borrow or Steal

BBOS is one of the oldest names in the space — they've been around since 2004 and famously got a mention on Sex and the City. Unlike the subscription services above, BBOS charges per rental rather than a flat monthly fee. Weekly rentals typically run $50–$200+ depending on the bag, which can add up quickly.

The per-rental model works well if you only need a bag for a specific event — a wedding, a vacation, a photoshoot. But if you want ongoing access to a designer bag as part of your everyday rotation, the per-rental fees become more expensive than a flat membership within a month or two.

BBOS also offers a buy and sell marketplace, so you can purchase pre-owned bags outright.

**Best for:** Occasional renters who want a specific bag for a specific event, rather than ongoing access.

**Pricing:** Per rental, varies by bag

## The Earning Angle: Why It Matters

One of the most interesting developments in luxury bag rental is the emergence of two-sided platforms — services that let bag owners put their collections to work. If you've spent $5,000 or $10,000 on a bag that spends most of its life on a shelf, there's a real financial argument for contributing it to a rental pool and earning passive income.

Right now, [The Handoffs](/for-bag-owners) is the only major service with a structured earn-back model where owners contribute bags and receive credits applied to their own membership. Smaller peer-to-peer platforms like RentOui exist, but they operate on a per-transaction basis without the membership structure.

If you own luxury bags and rent luxury bags, the math becomes compelling: your contributed bag earns credits that offset your membership cost, effectively reducing (or eliminating) what you pay to borrow.

## So Which Service Should You Choose?

There's no single best answer — it depends on what you're optimizing for.

If you want the **deepest catalog and the most established brand**, Vivrelle is hard to beat on selection alone, though you'll pay more for premier access.

If you want to **rent your entire wardrobe** (clothing, accessories, and bags), Rent the Runway's bundled model makes sense.

If you want a **simple, lower-cost entry point**, Switch gets you started at $59/month.

If you only need a **bag for a specific event**, Bag Borrow or Steal's per-rental model avoids monthly commitments.

And if you want a **flat-rate membership with the option to earn from your own bags** — or if you care about the circular fashion angle of keeping existing bags in rotation — [The Handoffs](/membership) is the only service that offers both sides of the equation.

Whichever direction you go, the broader trend is clear: the era of spending $3,000 to carry a designer bag is being replaced by something more flexible, more accessible, and — for bag owners willing to share — more financially rewarding.
